# Steps

After creating your campaign and adding contacts, Sonity needs to know how it will execute the campaign, thats where **Steps** come in!. Steps in Sonity are like what a recipe is to a chef and they define every step that Sonity to execute for each and every contact in the campaign.

## How do you define steps

Steps are defined from the **Steps Tab**. Most campaigns will come come with default steps:

## The structure of a Step

Most steps will contain either all or some of the following options

### 1. Like Post before interacton
This will like a contact's post before sending the message. Interacting with a contact's content before sending an unsolicitated message or a connection request has been proven to increase success

### 2. Template strings
Instead of sending general messages, Sonity allows you to send personalized messages through template string for example if click firstname literal

Hi `{firstname}`, how are you?

It will substitute `firstname` for every contact's name for example

Hi **John**, how are you?
Hi **Grace**, how are you?
Hi **Mark**, how are you?

### 3. Main Message
Main message is the main message that gets send if no issues occur.


### 4. Delay
A step is usually executed immediately (As long as the driver is in its execution window). However you may prefer sending the message after a certain delay. For example if a contact accepts your message you wouldn't want to execute a welcome message immediately and it will look fishy.

### 5. Fallback Message
When parsing issues occur, the fallback message gets sent. This ensures that the contact recieves the message even when an issue occur.


## Types if steps

There are many types of steps. However before diving into the steps please take a note of this:

**- Steps are unique in the way they are executed, so you cant send a Welcome Message using a Connection Message step and vise versa. So use a step for its intended purpose.**
**-  Connection Message and Welcome Message steps should be run once per contact in a campaign**


### 1. Connection Message Step
This step is used to send an Invite message to a contact. If this step succeeds you will have a new connection. Its mostly used in a Connection Campaign.
