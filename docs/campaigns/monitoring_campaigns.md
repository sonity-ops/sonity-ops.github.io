In the bottom chart we have Events chart and the Metric gauges

### 1. Events Charts
Its a bar chart that shows prospect statuses by date. For example on 12 December 2024, 10 prospects were in Connect Req Status, 40 prospects were in Message status, 5 were in Withdrawn status.

The **Time Of Operation** gives you fine grained control over the time of the Events chart

### 2. Metric Gauges
Metric gauges gives you a percentage of the metric in question. For example a Connection metric of 25% tells that out of 200 contacts, 50 contacts connected successfully.
