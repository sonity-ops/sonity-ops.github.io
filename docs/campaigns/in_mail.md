# What is a InMail Campaign

InMail Campaigns allows to send automated messages to prospects whom you are not connected to. It's
like send an unsolicitated email but with one twist, it always lands in their inbox.

You must upgrade to a Premium account to use InMail messages. You can’t message a member if they’ve chosen not to receive InMail messages in their message preferences settings.

You’re allotted a specific number of InMail message credits based on your subscription type. You can find the number of InMail message credits you have from your My Premium page.
