# Tips and Tricks for Effective Automation

## Start Slow and Gradual

Initiate with a slow and gradual automation approach to prevent triggering LinkedIn's spam filters. Mirror natural human behavior by incrementally increasing connection requests and messages.

## Targeted Connection Requests

Send connection requests to individuals who align with your professional interests or industry. Personalize connection requests with a brief, relevant message to enhance the likelihood of acceptance.

Sonity also allows you to use AI to generate more personalized messages from the 'Variants' section.


## Limit Daily Activities

Set reasonable limits on the number of connection requests, messages, and profile views per day. Mimic human behavior by spreading out your activities over time.

You can set or adjust your activity limits from the Profiles page.


## Personalized Messaging

Customize your automated messages to make them more personal and engaging. Avoid generic messages and tailor them to the recipient's profile or recent activities.

Sonity also allows you to use AI to generate more personal messages from the 'Variants' section. You can take advantage of this feature by navigating to the steps tab and then variants sub-step of your campaign as shown above.
    1. Click on the plus icon to create a new variant of the message template in your campaign. This will create an entry for it in the “Variant Text” table.
    2. Use can AI to generate message templates for you in a specific tone by clinking on the GPT icon. This creates an entry in the “Variant Text” table as well.
    3. Checking this option tells Sonity that you’d like to use this variant message in your campaign and unchecking it means you don’t want to include it.
    4. The edit action. This allows you edit your variant text as you see fit.
    5. The delete option. This removes the variant text from your “Variant Text” table   



## Monitor and adjust
Regularly monitor the performance of your automation tool. Adjust your settings based on the responses and engagement you receive. If certain actions are not yielding positive results, consider tweaking your approach. You can monitor your campaign from the Reports section of your campaign.

The metrics for your campaign are located under the Stats tab of your campaign. These show you an overview of how you campaign is going. The TCP chart shows you all the statuses for your prospects in your campaign and also how many prospects are at each stage of your campaign. The TCP summary table contains the same information but in a tabular format with exact figures.

Below the TCP Chart and Table, is the Events chart, which shows you all the events that were triggered in your campaign and when they were triggered. You can use these stats to determine when certain events are likely to occur for your campaign and adjust it accordingly. The metrics section is an overview of four important stats, the connection metric, the meeting metric, the replied to metric and the disconnected metric. [Need to find out how these are calculated and use that to emphasize their use to the user.]


## Use Proxies
Consider using proxies to avoid detection. Proxies can help distribute activity across different IP addresses, reducing the risk of being flagged. In Sonity, proxies are set and managed on a profile basis. You can change proxies from the Profile settings.

Under your profile settings, click on the Proxy dropdown to reveal the new proxy button. Click this to create a new proxy.

Give your proxy a name and specify the host (as an IP e.g. 127.0.0.1) and the port Sonity can use to connect to it. If yourproxy is passwod protected, check the “Password protected” option and it will reveal another section you can use to enter the authentication details to connect to it.

After this, you can simply click the “Add Proxy” button to confirm your proxy connection.
