Adjust your settings based on the responses and engagement you receive. If certain actions are not yielding positive results, consider tweaking your approach. You can monitor your campaign from the Reports section of your campaign.  The metrics for your campaign are located under the Stats tab of your campaign. These show you an overview of how you campaign is going. The TCP chart shows you all the statuses for your prospects in your campaign and also how many prospects are at each stage of your campaign. The TCP summary table contains the same information but in a tabular format with exact figures.    Below the TCP Chart and Table, is the Events chart, which shows you all the events that were triggered in your campaign and when they were triggered. You can use these stats to determine when certain events are likely to occur for your campaign and adjust it accordingly. The metrics section is an overview of four important stats, the connection metric, the meeting metric, the replied to metric and the disconnected metric.
